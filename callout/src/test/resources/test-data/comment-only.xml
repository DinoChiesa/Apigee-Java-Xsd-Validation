     Even though this document does not begin with the purchaseOrder element, it
     will be valid according to the schema, because comment is a toplevel
     element also. There is no way to specify, when validating with XSD, that
     the root element be a particular element. If applications want to check
     that, they  must perform that check as a second step.
